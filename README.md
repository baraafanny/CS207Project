# CS207Project
This repository will be for the project in CS207 - Building Interactive Gadgets.
This repository was made for the project in CS207 - Building Interactive Gadgets. 
This README will give instructions to how one might set-up an Interactive Piano with an Arduino Uno. 

The project involves building an Interactive Piano with different materials that you can find in your everyday home. 
Motivation for this project came when the authors friend showed some related work on YouTube. When watching the videos the author could see some possible improvements and fun ideas to add to these different projects. 

Picture of project here

Here is how the project looks. Different tiles of the piano are represented by two Redbull cans, two 2$ coins and three gummy bears. 

# Repository Content
Here is a list of the content in the repository
* /InteractivePiano - In this folder you can find the code for this project.
  * InteractivePiano.ino 
* /README.md - Second content is the README.

# Requirements and Materials
For this project we needed to use a library to be able to input human touch.
* Capacitive Sensing Library - Library I used to create the sensors, can be found [here](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense) 

Here is a list of the required materials
* Arduino Uno
* 7st 1M â„¦ resistors
* Piezo buzzer
* 2 Jumper wires for piezo buzzer
* 16 Jumper wires for the rest of the circuit
* The materials that you will attach to the touch sensors, in this case pop cans, coins and gummy bears
